# Futebol Mania

This project was a challenge proposed by the Inter Frontend Developer bootcamp.

I learned how to integrate a Front-end in React with a REST API (developed in Node.js). 
I used good writing practices in addition to using libraries such as Material UI and Bootstrap for light customization.
